title: _dir.yaml
---

## Why

To povide additional meta information about the steps in a lesson.

## Where

In the directory of each step in a lesson.

## What

A file named `_dir.yaml` that contains the following:

```yaml
---
title: Title of the step
---
```

Maybe more stuff could be here and the file itself could be optional in which case it will use the folder name as the title.
