title: Standard Markdown
---

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for creating formatted text documents. It was designed to be easy to read and write in plain text format, while also providing a simple way to format text for the web. Markdown is widely used for creating documentation, blogs, and other web-based content. The language uses a simple syntax of special characters and plain text to indicate formatting such as headings, bold or italicized text, lists, links, and images. Markdown files can be easily converted to HTML, PDF, and other formats, making it a versatile tool for creating and sharing content. The simplicity and versatility of Markdown have made it a popular choice among writers, developers, and other content creators.

## Text

::tab{:tabs='["Preview", "Code"]'}

#Preview

Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Lists

::tab{:tabs='["Preview", "Code"]'}

#Preview

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
    - Unordered sub-list.
3. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
    1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

    You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

    To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.  
     Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.  
     (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

-   Unordered list can use asterisks

*   Or minuses

-   Or pluses

*   [x] Task List -- First item
*   [ ] Task List -- Second item
*   [ ] Task List -- Third item

## Links

There are two ways to create links.

::tab{:tabs='["Preview", "Code"]'}

#Preview

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com>.

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

#Code

```md

## Footnotes

Footnotes aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they supported by GFM.

::tab{:tabs='["Preview", "Code"]'}

#Preview

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]:
    Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.
    This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.

[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.

## Tables

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM we support them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

::tab{:tabs='["Preview", "Code"]'}

#Preview

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   $12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

## Blockquotes

::tab{:tabs='["Preview", "Code"]'}

#Preview

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.
> #Code

```md

## Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

::tab{:tabs='["Preview", "Code"]'}

#Preview

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

#Code

```md
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>
```

## Horizontal Rule

::tab{:tabs='["Preview", "Code"]'}

#Preview

Asterisks

Underscores

## Line Breaks

My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit <Enter> once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. "Markdown Toggle" is your friend.

::tab{:tabs='["Preview", "Code"]'}

#Preview

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_.
