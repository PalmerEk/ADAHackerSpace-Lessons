title: Standard Markdown
---

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for creating formatted text documents. It was designed to be easy to read and write in plain text format, while also providing a simple way to format text for the web. Markdown is widely used for creating documentation, blogs, and other web-based content. The language uses a simple syntax of special characters and plain text to indicate formatting such as headings, bold or italicized text, lists, links, and images. Markdown files can be easily converted to HTML, PDF, and other formats, making it a versatile tool for creating and sharing content. The simplicity and versatility of Markdown have made it a popular choice among writers, developers, and other content creators.

#Preview

## Lists

::tab{:tabs='["Preview", "Code"]'}

#Preview

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
    - Unordered sub-list.
3. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
    1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

    You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

    To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.  
     Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.  
     (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

-   Unordered list can use asterisks

*   Or minuses

-   Or pluses

*   [x] Task List -- First item
*   [ ] Task List -- Second item
*   [ ] Task List -- Third item

## Links

There are two ways to create links.

::tab{:tabs='["Preview", "Code"]'}

#Preview

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com>.

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

#Code

```md
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)
