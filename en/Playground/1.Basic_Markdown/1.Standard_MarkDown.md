---

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for creating formatted text documents. It was designed to be easy to read and write in plain text format, while also providing a simple way to format text for the web. Markdown is widely used for creating documentation, blogs, and other web-based content. The language uses a simple syntax of special characters and plain text to indicate formatting such as headings, bold or italicized text, lists, links, and images. Markdown files can be easily converted to HTML, PDF, and other formats, making it a versatile tool for creating and sharing content. The simplicity and versatility of Markdown have made it a popular choice among writers, developers, and other content creators.
